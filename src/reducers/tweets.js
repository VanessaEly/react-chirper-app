// A Reducer describes how an application's state changes. Youâ€™ll often see the Object Spread Operator (...)
// used inside of a reducer because a reducer must return a new object instead of mutating the old state.
// Each reducer slices its own part of state

// Reducers have the following signature: (previousState, action) => newState
